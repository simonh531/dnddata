When you first gain the Equipment sphere, choose one Equipment talent of your choice and gain it for free.\n\nSome talents are marked (discipline). These talents grant groups of weapons with shared thematic roots that may be very different mechanically but are generally presented as being complementary somehow. Whenever a talent or ability refers to a weapon discipline, it affects all weapons included in any single (discipline) talent.\n\nSome (discipline) talents list weapons specific to particular regions or cultures. Such weapons have their equivalent standard weapon listed in parentheses immediately after their names."}
