Creatures that do not breathe are unaffected by Black Lung.\n\n**Augment 1 sp:** You can imbue your Black Lung with a dose of contact or inhalation poison held in your hand.

The target moves that direction as if it were their intended course. The target does not realize they are off-course until their next turn or until they leave the area of darkness.\n\nYou can take this talent a second time. Doing so grants the following augmentations:\n\n**Augment 0 sp:** You possess a modicum of control over your targets’ delusions.

If there is no other legal target within range, the attack or ability is not affected.

A shadow lurk appears as a shaded, obviously spurious version of the target. It is weightless and its equipment is entirely illusionary. It has the same skills, feats, and attributes as the target, except that its Strength score is 3 (Unless it would be lower, then use its normal Strength score), and only has a number of hit points equal to your level. The shadow lurk cannot attack, use class or racial abilities, cast spells or sphere effects, or any other abilities, though it can manipulate objects and use skills. A shadow lurk must remain within 300 feet of its original source or it ceases to exist. The target lacks a shadow while this effect is active.\n\nRetracting a shadow lurk is a bonus action. Either the target or the shadow lurk may spend this action. If a shadow lurk is killed or exceeds its range, it winks out of existence and the target’s shadow returns to them with a surge of energy that causes them to be stunned until the end of their next turn. In either case, the target immediately gains the knowledge of everything their shadow lurk observed and did while it was detached.\n\nBy investing a second talent in Shadow Lurk you master the art of weaving shadowstuff into your shadow lurks, giving them and their equipment increased substance. Your shadow lurks use the full Strength score of their source, have 2 hit points per level, and possess non-magical versions of their sources’ equipment. It has the same reach as the creature it is created from and may make a single attack per turn using non-magical versions of whatever weapons or natural attacks its source possesses. It attacks using its source’s full proficiency bonus, Strength score, and feats, but deals only half damage. A shadowstuff-imbued lurk still may not cast spells or sphere effects, or use its source’s class features. Consumable items, such as acid flasks or potions, created as part of your lurks do not function.","modifyId":"MELD"},"SHADOWED_MIEN_MELD":{"id":"SHADOWED_MIEN_MELD","type":"MELD","name":"shadowed mien (meld)","text":"You cloak the target in an aura of menacing shadow that conceals its appearance, subtle movements, and intentions behind a curtain of disconcerting murk.

Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern the target’s true intentions suffer disadvantage. The target has no difficulty seeing out of Shadowed Mien, but the effect cannot be penetrated by Darkvision. Clearsight and abilities that allow a creature to see through magical darkness allow the target of Shadowed Mien to be seen clearly. Creatures that can see the target clearly are not subject to the effects of this ability.\n\n**Augment 1 sp:** You can grant substance to the shadowy aura.
