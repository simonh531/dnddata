{"BLAST_TYPE":{"id":"BLAST_TYPE","name":"blast type","text":"If you possess certain other spheres, you gain additional ways to employ your destructive blast. **For each sphere you possess, you also gain one free (blast type) available to that sphere from the list below.**\n\nRegardless of how many talents or packages you possess, or later possess, in an individual sphere you only ever get one free (blast type) talent from that sphere. If you already possess all the (blast type) talents associated with that sphere, you can instead choose another blast type in its place, or exchange one instance of the Extra Blast Type talent for another talent in the Destruction sphere.\n\nSome blast types also require you to possess particular options within that sphere, such as those associated with the Nature sphere requiring certain geomancing packages. The Extra Blast Type talent grants access to additional blast types.\n\n**Blast Type Rider Effects:** Most (blast type) talents do two things. First, they determine the damage type of a destructive blast. Second, they offer a secondary effect that occurs if a creature is damaged by the destructive blast. These secondary effects are called rider effects.\n\n**Blast Types and Thematic Casters:** Spheres of Power was inspired to help players and GMs alike create thematic casters. The blast types below have specific (blast types) sorted by recommended theme. However, not all (blast types) match up perfectly to how that particular player may be building their character. GMs should work with their players when working with the Destruction sphere.\n\nFor example, the Bramble (blast type) could easily be renamed Crystal (blast type), replacing all instances of the word 'bramble' from the talent text with the word 'crystal' and making it an \\[earth geomancing\\] blast instead of \\[plant geomancing\\]. If a particular (blast type) doesn't fit the theme of a character possessing that sphere, the GM should work with the player to re-fluff or replace the (blast type) with another blast type from another sphere.\n\nExcept in the switching of physical damage types (bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing), GMs should generally avoid modifying what type of damage a (blast type) does when refluffing a (blast type) to fit a specific theme.","talentIds":["ALTERATION_SPHERE_FORM_BREAKING_BLAST_TYPE","ALTERATION_SPHERE_POISON_BLAST_TYPE","CONJURATION_SPHERE_RESTRAINING_BLAST_TYPE","CONJURATION_SPHERE_SPECTRAL_BLAST_TYPE","CREATION_SPHERE_CORROSIVE_BLAST_TYPE_ALTER_POWER","CREATION_SPHERE_PHYSICAL_BLAST_TYPE_CREATE_POWER","DARK_SPHERE_BESHADOWED_BLAST_TYPE","DARK_SPHERE_INK_BLAST_TYPE","DEATH_SPHERE_DRAINING_BLAST_TYPE","DEATH_SPHERE_NECROTIC_BLAST_TYPE","DIVINATION_SPHERE_PSIONIC_BLAST_TYPE","DIVINATION_SPHERE_PSYCHIC_DELUGE_BLAST_TYPE","ENHANCEMENT_SPHERE_DEGRADING_BLAST_TYPE","ENHANCEMENT_SPHERE_HINDERING_BLAST_TYPE","FATE_SPHERE_CURSED_BLAST_TYPE_CURSE","FATE_SPHERE_TRIBUNAL_BLAST_TYPE_CURSE","ILLUSION_SPHERE_BEWILDERING_BLAST_TYPE","ILLUSION_SPHERE_SHADOW_BLAST_TYPE","LIFE_SPHERE_INVIGORATING_BLAST_TYPE","LIFE_SPHERE_VIVACITY_BLAST_TYPE","LIGHT_SPHERE_ILLUMINATING_BLAST_TYPE","LIGHT_SPHERE_RADIANT_BLAST_TYPE","MIND_SPHERE_CHARMING_BLAST_TYPE","MIND_SPHERE_FRIGHTFUL_BLAST_TYPE","NATURE_SPHERE_BLUDGEONING_BLAST_TYPE_EARTH_GEOMANCING","NATURE_SPHERE_BRAMBLE_BLAST_TYPE_PLANT_GEOMANCING","NATURE_SPHERE_DROWNING_BLAST_TYPE_WATER_GEOMANCING","NATURE_SPHERE_FIRE_BLAST_TYPE_FIRE_GEOMANCING","NATURE_SPHERE_RAZOR_WIND_BLAST_TYPE_AIR_GEOMANCING","NATURE_SPHERE_SHRAPNEL_BLAST_TYPE_METAL_GEOMANCING","PROTECTION_SPHERE_CONFINING_BLAST_TYPE","PROTECTION_SPHERE_WARDING_BLAST_TYPE","TELEKINESIS_SPHERE_GRAVITY_BLAST_TYPE","TELEKINESIS_SPHERE_KINETIC_BLAST_TYPE","TIME_SPHERE_ENTROPIC_BLAST_TYPE","TIME_SPHERE_SLOWING_BLAST_TYPE","UNIVERSAL_SPHERE_CHROMATIC_BLAST_TYPE_WILD_MAGIC","UNIVERSAL_SPHERE_DISRUPTING_BLAST_TYPE_DISPEL","UNIVERSAL_SPHERE_SIPHONING_BLAST_TYPE_MANA","WARP_SPHERE_DISMISSING_BLAST_TYPE","WARP_SPHERE_TELEPORTING_BLAST_TYPE","WEATHER_SPHERE_GALE_BLAST_TYPE","WEATHER_SPHERE_ICE_BLAST_TYPE","WEATHER_SPHERE_LIGHTNING_BLAST_TYPE","WEATHER_SPHERE_SCORCHING_BLAST_TYPE","WEATHER_SPHERE_THUNDER_BLAST_TYPE"]},"BLAST_SHAPE":{"id":"BLAST_SHAPE","name":"blast shape","text":"","talentIds":["AURA_BLAST_SHAPE","BLADE_BLAST_SHAPE","CHAIN_BLAST_BLAST_SHAPE","EXPLOSIVE_ORB_BLAST_SHAPE","LEAP_BLAST_SHAPE","RAY_BLAST_SHAPE","RETRIBUTION_BLAST_SHAPE","SCULPT_BLAST_SHAPE","SPHERE_BLAST_SHAPE","TETHER_BLAST_SHAPE","WALL_BLAST_SHAPE"]},"BASIC":{"id":"BASIC","name":"basic","text":"","talentIds":["BLASTER_ADEPT","ENERGY_WEAPON","EPICENTER","EXTRA_BLAST_TYPE","GUIDED_STRIKE","SELECTIVE_BLAST"]},"ADVANCED":{"id":"ADVANCED","name":"advanced","text":"","talentIds":["CALAMITY_BLAST_SHAPE","CLOUD_BLAST_SHAPE","DISINTEGRATE_BLAST_TYPE","PENETRATING_BLAST"]}}
