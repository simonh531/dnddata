{"TACTICS":{"id":"TACTICS","name":"tactics","text":"Tactics are coordinated battle plans that require continuing direction from the practitioner to maintain. Starting and maintaining a tactic each round costs a bonus action. While a tactic is active, you and all allies within 20 feet of you who can see and hear you gain its benefits so long as you aren’t helpless, killed, paralyzed, rendered unconscious, or stunned. A creature cannot benefit from more than one tactic at a time.\n\nWhen you first gain the Warleader sphere, you gain Aggressive Flanking."},"SHOUTS":{"id":"SHOUTS","name":"shouts","text":"Shouts are sound-based effects you can perform as an action that affect creatures within 10 feet of you. You may choose whether or not to include yourself in the effects of your shout. Allies must be able to hear you to gain a shout’s benefits, and characters who cannot hear gain advantage on all saves against a harmful shout’s effects.\n\nWhile some shouts only affect allies or enemies, others affect all targets within their area of effect. When performing such a shout, you may spend a bonus action to warn your allies to cover their ears and negate the effects, but doing so gives enemies within the area of effect advantage on their saving throw against the shout’s effects.\n\nWhen you first gain the Warleader sphere, you gain Fierce Shout."}}
