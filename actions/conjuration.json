It can move and use its reaction and bonus actions on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action.\n\n**Augment 1 sp:** The casting time of summon becomes an action.\n\n**Augment 2 sp:** The effect persists for the remaining duration without concentration. This augment may be applied after the effect is cast on your turn without an action."}}
