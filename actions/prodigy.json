{"FOCUSED_SEQUENCE":{"id":"FOCUSED_SEQUENCE","name":"focused sequence","text":"At 7th level, you can expend your martial focus with no action on your turn to increase your sequence by 1 link. Alternatively, as a bonus action you can cease concentration on a magic effect. This does not count against your usual total of 1 link per turn, but cannot be done if your sequence is already at its maximum, and cannot be benefited from more than once per round."}}
