You can grant yourself an additional talent from a magic sphere that you possess as an action. You retain knowledge of this talent for 1 minute or until you use this ability again, whichever comes first. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your key ability modifier. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest."}}
